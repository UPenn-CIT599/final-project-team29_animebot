## Technical Specifications
How this all works.
### Overview
Our Slack Anime Bot is based on the [JBot Framework](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot) <br /> 
JBot is an event driven, Java framework that is available with all the boilerplate code which handles the underlying WebSocket connections and other complexities <br /> 
Bots interact with Slack through WebSockets, specifically the RTM API <br /> 
The JBot Framework code is contained in the jbot project folder. Team 29 is responsible for all code in the animebot module <br /> 

We leverage the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/) to fetch information from MyAnimeList.net <br /> 
Jikan is an unofficial MyAnimeList API. It uses an open-source PHP & REST API for the “most active online anime + manga 
community and database” — MyAnimeList. It parses the website to satisfy the need for an API

In general, an Application Program Interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. 
An API specifies how software components should interact. In simple terms, it is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
